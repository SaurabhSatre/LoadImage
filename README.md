Created a simple webpage for an image gallery that loads images quickly.
The webpage displays a title ("Select Image") and a grid layout for displaying images.
Each image is contained within a div element with the class "image-container".
The CSS styles ensure that the webpage is responsive and visually appealing.
The image data is stored in a JavaScript array named "imageData", which contains objects with properties such as "title", "subtitle", and "image".
The JavaScript code dynamically generates HTML elements for each image using the imageData array.
Upon loading the webpage, the loadImages function is called to populate the grid with images.
Each image is displayed with its title and subtitle below it.
The webpage is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear navigation and easy image viewing.
